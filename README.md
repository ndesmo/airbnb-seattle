Predicting AirBnb Review Scores

In this project we will be analyzing the customer experience from a subset of the AirBnb Seattle dataset and attempting to understand what AirBnb hosts can do to improve the customer experience.

Please see the Jupyter notebook for this project in Seattle Data.ipynb. 

A compiled version of this notebook is also available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/commit/understanding-customer-experience
